As a hydrologist, I am at the forefront of tackling the global challenge of water scarcity by employing a blend of state-of-the-art hydrological models, remote sensing technologies, and machine learning. My work is rooted in a deep understanding of water systems and is driven by a passion for developing sustainable water management and conservation solutions.
