## 👋 About Me

I am a hydrologist and interdisciplinary researcher working at the intersection of water resources, hydrology, remote sensing, machine learning, and coupled human-natural systems. My work integrates advanced hydrological modeling and data-driven methods to address the global challenge of water scarcity, with the goal of supporting resilient and sustainable water management strategies.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in [Marine Sciences](https://sos.cugb.edu.cn/) from the [China University of Geosciences (Beijing)](https://en.cugb.edu.cn/), a Master's in [Earth and Environmental Engineering](https://www.eee.columbia.edu/) from [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/), and a Master of Science in [Computer and Information Technology](https://online.seas.upenn.edu/degrees/mcit-online/) from the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/). This diverse academic background enables me to approach water challenges from both physical science and computational perspectives.

Currently, I am pursuing a Ph.D. in the [Department of Geography, Environment, and Spatial Sciences](https://geo.msu.edu/) at [Michigan State University](https://msu.edu/), where I am advised by [Dr. Lifeng Luo](https://geo.msu.edu/directory/luo-lifeng.html). I am also completing a dual major in [Environmental Science and Policy](https://esp.msu.edu/), with a focus on climate variability and policy-relevant research.
